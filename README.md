# Tecnica 55

Tecnica 55 is inspired by dot matrix printing technologies, a method used in the past for printers and digital displays, where characters were formed by a grid of dots. This technique allowed text and images to be reproduced on low-resolution devices.
Tecnica 55 uses a 5x5 dot matrix, creating bold and geometric characters.
The font is perfectly suited for technical and digital content, providing an aesthetic that evokes the world of technology and precision.
